                I replaced the extruded in my 3D printer today! The pre-assembled extruders were all out of stock, so I had to buy the parts for one (which got lost in the mail, so had to place a second orderâ€¦), put it together, and then pull out the old clogged extruder in the printer and replace it with the new one I assembled.

                I've always been kind of intimidated by hardware and am really proud of myself for getting this done! + bonus sunset picture from tonight
